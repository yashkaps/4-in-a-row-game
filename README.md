# 4-in-a-row-game
Aiming to implement an AI that can play the board game 4-in-a-row

## Update:
As of the latest commit, 2 player mode is already implemented, and works as intended.

A simple AI has been implemented that only evaluates the current board and plays according to that. Next step is to implement the minimax algorithm.
