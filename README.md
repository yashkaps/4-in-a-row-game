# 4-in-a-row-game
Aiming to implement an AI that can play the board game 4-in-a-row

## Update:
As of the latest commit, 2 player mode is already implemented, and works as intended.

The implementation of the AI has already started, but it might take a while since I'm trying to implement it myself without looking at some readymade piece of code
